<p>Make the red box such that when it is clicked, it moves 300 pixels to the right and 15 pixels down, and slowly turns into a circle, over the course of 2 seconds.</p>
<p>Then, 1 second after the animation is done running (so 3 seconds after the box is clicked), make the red circle go back to its original position, and make it turn blue. Once again the circle should be animating over a course of 2 seconds.</p>
<p> While this can be done with jQuery's animation capabilities, for simple transitions such as this, we should use <a href="http://www.css3.info/preview/css3-transitions/">CSS3 transitions</a>. To that end, <strong>make sure to use CSS3 transitions</strong> to achieve this. Yes, you will still need to write some JS/jQuery since clicking the red box needs to trigger the CSS3 transition.</p>
